# DestructiveBatteryTester
Test battery capacity by discharging with constant current. For Alkaline AA and other cells.

# Hardware
The hardware is based on an Arduino Nano. Others are possible of course, nearly no limitations.
The display is a Nokia 5110 LCD. This also is easy to modify.
The constant current source is based on an OP-Amp, see link to EasyEDA project:
